# Description

There are a bunch of tools and libraries that I use every once in a while. I,
however, use them too little to remember the specific options, but too often
to not write it down. This repository contains a collection of short references
of software that I use most often.

# Collection

* [multi-gitter](multi-gitter/README.md): a tool to make changes in multiple
  repositories simultaneously.
* [pre-commit](pre-commit/README.md): a framework for managing and maintaining
  multi-language pre-commit hooks.
